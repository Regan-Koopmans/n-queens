# n-queens

A solver for the n-queens problem based on Constraint Satisfaction. Written in Rust.

## How to Compile

You will need `rust` and `cargo` installed to compile this program. Just type:

`cargo build`
`cargo run 4`

To run the program to solve the 4 queens problem. The 4 in this command can be substituted with any 
number (I have tested up to 64). Do note that not all numbers have a solution :P 

## Issues

For some reason, it will sometimes enter a infinite loop, I am still working on why this occurs.
